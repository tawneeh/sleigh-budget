    <button onClick={props.onClick} style={{
      font: 'inherit', // to inherit the font from the rest of the page
      cursor: 'pointer' // pointer will be a hand cursor over the button!
    }}>
    </button>

    Inline styling might have some drawbacks. Can't use pseudo effects like hover with inline styling. 

    How about styled components?? Powerful real CSS styling. Install the package npm install --save styled-components. Import styled from 'styled-components'; A little complex. It takes CSS code you write and adds it into the head and automatically creates a new class name to assign to your component. *** Might go with this! Hover, etc is easy to do with styled components.
